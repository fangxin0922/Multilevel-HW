This scatter plot shows the association between students sense of discrimination and emotional safety at school, without accounting for clustering of students within schools. We plotted self-identified male and female gender separately. The blue line represents the estimated regression line. The plots show an increased sense of discrimination is associated with a decreased sense of emotional security.

We chose to show a scatter plot over a histogram as we wanted to visualize the association between the two variables, discrimination and emotional safety, rather than the distributions of the individual variables.

2. Does sense of emotional safety vary by gender and grade?
======================================================================
Our model will contain a random intercept for each school, a random slope for gender while including grade as a covariate due to the following reasons: 
From the data exploration we saw that the data was clustered, therefore our model will include a random intercept for school ID. Since different school have surveys collected from different grades, we decided to control for grade in our model, specially using it as predictor for the random intercept (grade may explain partially why there is school clustered effect). The relationship between emotional safety and gender/grade may vary across schools, therefore we have decided to fit a random slope model. In addition, we will also include grade in our level 1 model to see whether emotional vary by gender. 

The model is as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
esafe_{ij} &= \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} (gender)_{ij} +\beta_{2} (grade)_{ij}+ \varepsilon_{ij} \\
\beta_{0j} &= \gamma_{00} +\gamma_{01}\overline{grade}_j + \zeta_{0j} \\
\beta_{1j} &= \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1j}
\end{aligned}
$$
Fitting the model: 
```{r Q2}
#standardizing esafe and disc
dat$esafe_std <- scale(dat$esafe)
dat$disc_std <- scale(dat$disc)
dat$gender <- as.factor(dat$gender)
#calculate mean grade of each school 
dat <- dat %>% group_by(ID) %>% mutate(grade_mean = mean(grade), disc_mean = mean(disc)) 

m2 <- lmer(esafe_std ~ gender + grade + grade_mean +  (1 + gender|ID), dat)

m2 %>% tidy()
```
The model indicates there are gender differences. Controlling for grade, on average females has 0.0916 units increase in the SD of emotional safety score as compared to males. The P-value of 0.003 < 0.05, meaning that the association between gender and emotional safety is statistically significant at 5% level of significance. Controlling for gender, on average each 1 grade higher predicts a 0.0410 units increase in the SD of emotional safety score.

\newpage

3. Do those who feel discriminated against feel less safe?
======================================================================
**Answer**: The statistical model should allow the relationship between emotional safety and feeling discriminated to vary across school. Since gender and grade are predictors of emotional safety, we will include them in our model to control for them.
We will use a multilevel model to account for the nested structure of the data.
The model is as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
esafe_{ij} &= \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} (disc)_{ij} +\beta_{2} (gender)_{ij} + \beta_{2} (grade)_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
\beta_{0j} &= \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} \overline{disc}_j + \gamma_{02}\overline{grade}_j + \zeta_{0j} \\
\beta_{1j} &= \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1j}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $i$ indexes students and $j$ indexes schools.
```{r Q3}
m3 <- lmer(esafe_std ~ disc_std + disc_mean + gender + grade + grade_mean + (1 + disc_std|ID), dat)
m3 %>% tidy() %>% knitr::kable(digits = 4)
summary(m3)
arm::display(m3)
#confidence intervals 
confint(m3, method = c("Wald")) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
The model indicates that there is a negative relationship between emotional safety and feeling discriminated against.
Within schools, on average, a one-unit increase in SD of discrimination score predicts a 0.37 (95%CI:-0.407, -0.324) units **decrease** in the SD of emotional safety, adjusting for gender, grade, and school average grade. This is statistically significant (95% CI does not include 0).
Comparing two students of the same individual discrimination score, the one that goes to a school whose average discrimination score is 1SD higher is predicted to have 0.32 (95%CI:-0.490, -0.147) units **decrease** in the SD of emotional safety , adjusting for grade, school average grade, and gender. This is also statistically significant (95% CI does not include 0).

\newpage	
4. Contextual effects for discrimination?
======================================================================
``` {r Q4} 

m4 <- lmer(esafe_std ~ disc_std + disc_mean + gender + grade + grade_mean + (1 + disc_std|ID), dat)

summary(m4)
confint(m4, method = c("Wald")) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
random_effects <- ranef(m4)

# Check the random slope for disc_std
random_effects$ID$disc_std

``` 

a) Is there a contextual effect for discrimination with regard to emotional safety?  

Here we are looking at both the fixed effect of discrimination on emotional safety and how the relationship between discrimination and emotional safety varies by school ID. 

The results show that comparing students with the same individual discrimination score, a 1 unit (1 SD in this case) increase in average discrimination score at the school level (disc_mean) is predicted to have a 0.32 unit decrease (-0.49, -0.15) in emotional safety, adjusting for individual grade, school level average grade, and gender (p < 0.0001).

We included random effects to allow discrimination to vary by school ID. We see variation in the slope for discrimination at the individual level (disc_std) across the different school IDs. In some cases the slope is negative, while in others it is positive. We can calculate the proportion of the variance explained by including random slopes for individual level discrimination as: 0.009 / (0.009 + 0.759) ≈ 0.012  ≈ 1.12%.


b) Once you take out the contextual effect, if any, does the relationship at the student level of sense of discrimination and emotional safety change?  

```{r}
m5 <- lmer(esafe_std ~ disc_std + disc_mean + gender + grade + grade_mean + (1|ID), dat)

summary(m5)

```

When accounting for the contextual effect, the student level effect of sense of discrimination on emotional safety is -3.66e-01 with SD 2.09e-02 and when we remove the random slope for discrimination the effect is 3.54e-01  with SD 1.08e-02. Removing the contextual effect does not result in a large change in the effect of discrimination on emotional safety at the student level. 

Once you have answered this, reflect on the following:  
c) What, if anything, does it add substantively to do this within-school and contextual effect analysis?  

The within school and contextual effect analysis allows for us to see whether there is variation in the effect of discrimination on emotional safety by school. If we saw that there was a lot of variation in the effect of discrimination and emotional safety across schools, we could investigate at the school level whether there are additional differences that may lead to this variation that we had not previously accounted for. For example, perhaps neighborhood SES is an important predictor that we did not account for, and if included may explain for some of the variation by school. 

We also included a random intercept for ID, which allows for us to account for baseline differences in average emotional safety of the different schools. This allows for us to account for clustering within school ID. We can look at the individual modeled intercepts to evaluate whether the average emotional safety varies across schools after accounting for the confounding variables. 

Overall, the within school and contextual effect analysis can allow for us to look at variation at the group or cluster level.
